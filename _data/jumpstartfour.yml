  title: TAS7733 - [ SpotFire DataSource demo - Joining Spaces with OnDemand Tables ]
  desc: This movie shows you the steps to create and use dynamic OnDemand tables for TIBCO ActiveSpaces v2.1.x data sources. This technique lets you create “Master/Detail” data relationships where the “Detail” data can be stored in a massive data store, but you only load matching related Space entries, as needed, into TIBCO SpotFire working memory.
