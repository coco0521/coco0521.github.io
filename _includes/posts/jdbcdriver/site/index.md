The JDBC Driver for TIBCO ActiveSpaces provides Java applications with the ability to interact with ActiveSpaces through the use of SQL commands.

The driver can be used to port existing applications, which already use a JDBC driver to interact with a database, to ActiveSpaces.

The JDBC Driver for TIBCO ActiveSpaces can also facilitate the use of ActiveSpaces by those users who are familiar with the use of JDBC drivers by reducing their learning curve.
